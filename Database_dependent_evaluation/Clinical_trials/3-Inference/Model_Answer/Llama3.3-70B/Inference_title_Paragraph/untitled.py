 Change in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) from baseline to week 52. The eGFR will be calculated using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) study equation. The primary outcome will be the change in eGFR from baseline to week 52, with a negative value indicating a decline in renal function. The eGFR will be measured at baseline, week 26, and week 52. The primary outcome will be analyzed using a mixed effects model for repeated measures (MMRM) to account for the correlation between the repeated measurements. The MDRD equation is: eGFR (mL/min/1.73 m^2) = 175 x (serum creatinine)^-1.154 x (age)^-0.203 x (0.742 if female) x (1.212 if African American). The primary outcome measure will be the change in eGFR from baseline to week 52, with a negative value indicating a decline in renal function. The eGFR will be calculated at each visit and the change from baseline will be calculated. The primary outcome will be the change in eGFR from baseline to week 52. The primary outcome measure will be the change in eGFR from baseline to week 52. The primary outcome will be the change in eGFR from baseline to week 52.
